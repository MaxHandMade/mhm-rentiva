/**
 * Embedded RSA public key for verifying license-server feature tokens.
 *
 * Since v4.31.0, the server (`mhm-license-server` v1.10.0+) signs feature
 * tokens with its private key (held only in wp-config). This class ships
 * the matching public key as a class constant so the customer never has
 * to configure anything (zero-config UX preserved). Public keys can verify
 * but cannot mint signatures, so a cracked binary cannot forge a token.
 *
 * Release process:
 * 1. Generate the production key pair on a trusted dev machine ONCE
 *    (`openssl genpkey ... && openssl pkey -in ... -pubout`).
 * 2. Embed the production public PEM into the {@see self::PEM} nowdoc
 *    BEFORE tagging the v4.31.0 release. The fixture key below is the
 *    development-time placeholder paired with `tests/fixtures/`.
 * 3. Deploy the matching private key to the server's wp-config
 *    (`MHM_LICENSE_SERVER_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM`) at the same time.
 *
 * The {@see tests/fixtures/test-rsa-public.pem} file is byte-identical to
 * this constant during development so the unit suite exercises real
 * `openssl_verify` calls. When the constant is swapped for the production
 * PEM at release time, tests still pass because they inject the fixture
 * public key into {@see FeatureTokenVerifier} directly via constructor DI.
